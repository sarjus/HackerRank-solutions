# HackerRank-solutions
Welcome to my HackerRank solutions repository! Within this repository, you will find my solutions to various challenges that I have successfully completed on HackerRank.

This code includes solutions for challenges available at the following link: https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/algorithms
##  Problem 1: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/build-a-string/

Solution: The program aims to find the minimum cost of forming a string by appending substrings from the given input string. The cost is calculated based on parameters cost_a and cost_b, and the final minimum cost for each test case is printed. The algorithm iterates through the characters of the input string, identifying substrings and updating the costs accordingly.

##  Problem 2: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/build-a-string

Solution: The program uses various helper functions to modularize the logic and improve readability. It employs a compression step to reduce repeated characters and optimizes palindrome length calculations for circular strings. The core idea is to find circular palindromes for each rotation of the input string and output the lengths of the maximum palindromes found in each rotation.

##  Problem 3: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/build-a-string

Solution: The program uses recursive matching to handle cases where substrings are divided into two halves, and it checks for matches in all possible substrings of the original string. If matches are found, it prints the indices; otherwise, it outputs "No Match!". The logic is implemented using clear and modular functions, making the code readable and maintainable.
