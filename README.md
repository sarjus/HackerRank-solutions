##  Solutions
Problem: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/build-a-string/
Solution: The program aims to find the minimum cost of forming a string by appending substrings from the given input string. The cost is calculated based on parameters cost_a and cost_b, and the final minimum cost for each test case is printed. The algorithm iterates through the characters of the input string, identifying substrings and updating the costs accordingly.
